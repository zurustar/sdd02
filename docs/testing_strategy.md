# Web Service Testing Strategy

This document outlines a pragmatic testing strategy for Flask-based web services. The goal is to provide fast feedback during development, maintain confidence in critical functionality, and support iterative delivery.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Test the behavior that users rely on.** Focus on authentication, authorization, data validation, and workflows that span multiple requests.
2. **Prefer deterministic, isolated tests.** Use in-memory or temporary databases and disable non-essential integrations when testing.
3. **Adopt test-driven development (TDD).** Write or update tests _before_ changing production code to prevent regressions and document expectations.
4. **Keep tests fast and focused.** Small, isolated tests should run in seconds to support frequent execution in CI pipelines.

## Test Pyramid

The strategy follows a lightweight test pyramid:

- **Unit Tests** verify the smallest pieces of logic (e.g., model helpers, validation utilities). They run quickly and have minimal dependencies.
- **Integration Tests** exercise database interactions, form validation, and Flask route handlers via the application test client. They ensure that components work together correctly.
- **End-to-End Smoke Tests** (optional) hit high-value user journeys—such as registration, login, and creating schedules—to ensure major flows function. These can be written as integration tests that simulate browser interactions through the Flask client.

## Core Scenarios to Cover

1. **Authentication**
   - Registering new users, handling duplicate usernames, and enforcing password rules.
   - Logging in/out, rejecting invalid credentials, and redirecting authenticated users correctly.

2. **Authorization**
   - Protecting routes with `@login_required`.
   - Ensuring users cannot modify or delete resources they do not own.

3. **Scheduling Workflows**
   - Creating, editing, and deleting schedules with proper validation of date ranges and room assignments.
   - Sharing schedules with team members and ensuring shared items appear in calendars.

4. **Meeting Rooms Management**
   - CRUD operations for rooms, including duplicate name checks and capacity validation.
   - Preventing deletion of rooms that are still assigned to schedules.

5. **Regression Safeguards**
   - Every reported bug should be captured by a failing test before a fix is introduced.
   - High-risk areas (authentication, scheduling logic, database constraints) should always have automated coverage.

## Tooling & Execution

- **Test Runner:** Use `pytest` with `pytest-flask` style fixtures for readability and fixture reuse.
- **Database:** Configure tests to use an in-memory SQLite database and call `db.create_all()`/`db.drop_all()` per test session.
- **Factories/Fixtures:** Provide fixtures for application, client, and sample entities (users, rooms, schedules) to reduce duplication.
- **CI Integration:** Configure continuous integration to run `pytest` on every commit and pull request. Failing tests must block merges.

## Workflow

1. When starting work on a feature or bug fix, add or update tests that express the desired behavior.
2. Run the full test suite locally (`pytest`). Ensure it fails when the behavior is missing or broken.
3. Implement or adjust production code until the tests pass.
4. Keep the suite green—no skipped failures or flaky tests.
5. Review and refactor tests periodically to maintain clarity and eliminate duplication.

By following this approach, the team can detect regressions early, document expected behaviors, and ship reliable updates with confidence.

# Agent Collaboration Rules
To ensure smooth collaboration and avoid redundant work, all agents must adhere to the following workflow:
1.  **Plan All Tasks:** At the beginning of a major development phase, list all necessary tasks in `TASKS.md`.
2.  **Declare Your Task:** Before starting any task, announce which one you are working on.
3.  **Mark as Complete:** Once you have successfully completed a task, mark it as done by checking the checkbox, like this: `[x]`.
4.  **Keep Documentation Current:** Whenever you change code or behavior that affects user-facing functionality or setup steps, update `README.md` in the same change so that it stays accurate.
5.  **Write Tests First:** For every bug fix or feature, add or update the automated tests that cover the change **before** modifying production code.
This process helps everyone stay informed about the project plan, ongoing work, and completed work.

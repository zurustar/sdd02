# Agent Collaboration Rules

To ensure smooth collaboration and avoid redundant work, all agents must adhere to the following workflow:

1.  **Plan All Tasks:** At the beginning of a major development phase, list all necessary tasks in `TASKS.md`.
2.  **Declare Your Task:** Before starting any task, announce which one you are working on.
3.  **Mark as Complete:** Once you have successfully completed a task, mark it as done by checking the checkbox, like this: `[x]`.

This process helps everyone stay informed about the project plan, ongoing work, and completed work.
